Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset¶
Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

Instructions:

Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
You will learn to:

Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
Initializing parameters
Calculating the cost function and its gradient
Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

Packages¶
First, let's run the cell below to import all the packages that you will need during this assignment.

numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
h5py is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
matplotlib is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
PIL and scipy are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.
